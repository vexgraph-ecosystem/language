# language — Repo-Local Living Preferences
> Universal constitution: `gist.md` is the compressed law list; `PREFERENCES.md` is its rationale.

## 0. Constitution Link (supreme)
- [gist.md](https://gist.github.com/vex-graph/4132a6c45cb6d3797c3e8eff2e94035a#file-gist-md) — the compressed law list, mirrored in this workspace at `../../../metadata/gists/preferences/gist.md`. It is the only normative law text; `../../../PREFERENCES.md` carries the rationale and is never ingested whole. Numbers are slice addresses inside one file, never law identity: cite by Title.
- All universal laws bind this repository. Read one on demand from the workspace root: `./tools/prefs law "<title>"`, `./tools/prefs section "<section>"`, `./tools/prefs repo <name>`.
- This document codifies **exclusive** preferences for `language` (R3 Language Grammars). Grammar/AST semantics stay R3; borrow R2 Vexspoke computation/behavior or Relational Engine memory/storage/native C search contracts. Implemented: callback lexical coordinator and explicit C23 adapter; immutable revisioned document snapshots; validated snapshot-bound token stream; caller-fed project/build-target model and dependency graph; versioned project symbol/reference index. Planned: filesystem discovery, parsing/AST, semantic resolution, automatic invalidation, compiler services and LSP transport. No default allocator replacement or schema migration is implied.

## 1. Repo-Local Law Index (Binding Matrix)

Universal laws are inherited from the compressed constitution (`../../../metadata/gists/preferences/gist.md`); this table indexes the additional laws specific to this repository.

| Law Title | Scope | Enforcement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hot-Swappable Grammar Module Law** | R3 Language Grammars | Mandatory for `language` |
| **Single-Class-Per-File Grammar Law** | R3 Language Grammars | Mandatory for `language` |

## 2. Exclusive Repo-Local Laws (FULL PROSE RESTATEMENT)

### Hot-Swappable Grammar Module Law

#### Definition:
Grammars are independent dynamically loadable modules exporting standard parser vtables and token iterators, swappable at runtime without restarting the language server.

#### The Why:
Enable rapid BNF grammar and AST-builder iteration without recompiling clients.

#### The Rule:
1. **Seam Interface:** Every grammar dylib exports `Grammar_init`, `Grammar_parse`, and `Grammar_destroy` symbols.
2. **Stateless AST:** Parsers output relational AST nodes into caller-provided memory pools.

---

### Single-Class-Per-File Grammar Law

#### Definition:
Grammar rules, lexers, AST node builders, and token definitions each occupy a dedicated `.h`/`.c` pair named for the class in lowercase.

#### The Why:
Sharing a translation unit across token types and rule matchers makes grammar logic unmaintainable.

#### The Rule:
1. **One Class:** Each grammar file pair has exactly one public struct.
