// callers keep a separate state per document and reset it before a new patch.
// The line is a byte span without its LF delimiter; the optional final CR is
// accepted for CRLF input. outToken receives one token covering that line.
// On rejection, both inHunk and outToken are preserved and a diagnostic is
// emitted through THROW. This adapter classifies patch structure only; it does
// not tokenize the program text carried by added/deleted lines.
